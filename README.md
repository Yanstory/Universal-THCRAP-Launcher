## What is UTL?
UTL is a third-party program that replaces the clutter of shortcuts that [THCRAP](https://github.com/thpatch/thcrap) creates by being a program that allows you to choose a patch configuration (list of mods and translations on top of each other) and an executable file (game or custom.exe) to run trough THCRAP.

## Installation
 - Extract the files from `utl.rar`.
 - Place the files next to `thcrap_configure.exe` and `thcrap_launcher.exe`.
 - Run `Universal THCRAP Launcher.exe`.

## Adding/Updating Languages
The language files are in the [langs folder](https://github.com/Tudi20/Universal-THCRAP-Launcher/tree/master/langs).
Just send a push request, and I will have a look-trough and will accept the push request.
